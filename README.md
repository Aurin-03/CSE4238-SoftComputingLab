# CSE4238-SoftComputingLab


This a project which utilizes a deep learning approach to forecast rainfall, temperature, and humidity patterns. The dataset used in the project was collected from the Climate Information Management System of BARC (Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council). The collected data of the year 2000 to 2022 from 8 districts of Bangladesh will be used to train deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to forecast rainfall, temperature, and humidity patterns. Python language is used for this project and Google Colab is used to create and train models for desired forecasting. This project is a part of Soft Computing Lab (CSE-4238) and is supervised by Mr. Mohammad Marufur Rahman (Lecturer, AUST) and Mr. Md. Reasad Zaman Chowdhury (Lecturer, AUST).
