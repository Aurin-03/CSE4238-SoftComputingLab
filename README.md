## Project Title
Deep Learning-Based Multivariate Forecasting of Rainfall, Temperature, and Humidity Patterns


## About

### Idea and Inspiration
In the intricate tapestry of Bangladesh's climate, the accurate prediction of rainfall, temperature, and humidity patterns stands as a crucial endeavor with far-reaching implications. As climate change accelerates and the frequency of extreme weather events intensifies, the need for advanced forecasting methods becomes paramount. Deep Learning-Based Multivariate Forecasting emerges as a groundbreaking solution that holds the potential to revolutionize our understanding and preparedness for the dynamic climatic conditions in Bangladesh.



## Approach

### About:
This project employs a deep learning approach to enhance the precision of forecasting rainfall, temperature, and humidity patterns in Bangladesh, with the overarching goal of predicting future climate trends in the region.

### DataSet: 
The dataset used in the project was collected from the Climate Information Management System of BARC (Bangladesh Agriculture Research Council)
The collected data from the year 2000 to 2022 from 8 districts of Bangladesh is used.

### Model:
* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)
* Bi-Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM)

### Materials Used:
* Language: Python
* IDE: Colab

### Supervisors: 
* Mr. Mohammad Marufur Rahman (Lecturer, AUST)
* Mr. Md. Reasad Zaman Chowdhury (Lecturer, AUST).
